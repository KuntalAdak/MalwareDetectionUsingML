**Problem** **Statement** :
Detect if there is presence of malicious software by using machine learning algorithms from the attributes extracted from applications as features.

**Steps** **Involved**:

> Defining the problem statement : here we are detecting malicious software

> Reading the data in python : reading dataset from csv file

> Identifying the Target variable : the target variable is class

> Looking at the distribution of Target variable : target variable is distributed in B & S form

> Basic Data exploration

> Rejecting useless columns : no useless columns found

> Visual Exploratory Data Analysis for data distribution (Barcharts)

> Feature Selection based on data distribution

> Outlier treatment : no outlier found based on charts

> Missing Values treatment : total 5 missing values found and treated as np.NaN

> Visual correlation analysis : corr matrix heatmap

> Converting data to numeric for ML : converted categorical data into 0's and 1's

> Standardization/Normalization of data

> Statistical Feature Selection (Categorical Vs Categorical)

> Trying multiple Regression algorithms : DECISION TREE, SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE, LOGISTIC REGRESSION, K - Nearest Neighbour

> Visualising all Model accuracy on graph and selecting best model
